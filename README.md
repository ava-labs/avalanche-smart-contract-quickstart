## Introduction

Avalanche is an open-source platform for launching decentralized applications and enterprise blockchain deployments in one interoperable, highly scalable ecosystem. Avalanche gives you complete control on both the network and application layers&mdash;helping you build anything you can imagine.

The Avalanche Network is composed of many blockchains. One of these blockchains is the C-Chain (Contract Chain), which is an Ethereum Virtual Machine instance. The C-Chain's API is almost identical to an Ethereum node's API. Avalanche offers the same interface as Ethereum but with higher speed, higher throughput, lower fees and lower transaction confirmation times. These properties considerably improve the performance of DApps and the user experience of smart contracts.

The goal of this guide is to lay out best practices regarding writing, testing and deployment of smart contracts to Avalanche's C-Chain. We'll be building smart contracts with development environment [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org).

## Prerequisites

### NodeJS and Yarn

First, install the LTS (long-term support) version of [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en). This is `14.17.0` at the time of writing. NodeJS bundles `npm`.

Next, install [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com):

```zsh
npm install -g yarn
```

### AvalancheGo and Avash

[AvalancheGo](https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanchego) is an Avalanche node implementation written in Go. [Avash](https://docs.avax.network/build/tools/avash) is a tool to quickly deploy local test networks. Together, you can deploy local test networks and run tests on them.

### Solidity and Avalanche

It is also helpful to have a basic understanding of [Solidity](https://docs.soliditylang.org) and [Avalanche](https://docs.avax.network).

## Dependencies

Clone the [quickstart repository](https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanche-smart-contract-quickstart) and install the necessary packages via `yarn`.

```zsh
$ git clone https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanche-smart-contract-quickstart.git
$ cd avalanche-smart-contract-quickstart
$ yarn
```

## Write Contracts

Edit the `Coin.sol` contract in `contracts/`. `Coin.sol` is an [Open Zeppelin](https://openzeppelin.com) [ERC20](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20) contract. ERC20 is a popular smart contract interface. You can also add your own contracts.

## Hardhat Config

Hardhat uses `hardhat.config.js` as the configuration file. You can define tasks, networks, compilers and more in that file. For more information see [here](https://hardhat.org/config/).

In our repository we use a pre-configured file [hardhat.config.ts](https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanche-smart-contract-quickstart/blob/main/hardhat.config.ts). This file configures necessary network information to provide smooth interaction with Avalanche. There are also some pre-defined private keys for testing on a local test network.

## Hardhat Tasks

You can define custom hardhat tasks in [hardhat.config.ts](https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanche-smart-contract-quickstart/blob/main/hardhat.config.ts).

## Snowtrace Verification

To try out Snowtrace verification, you first need to deploy a contract to an Avalanche network that's supported by Snowtrace, such as Fuji, C-Chain.

In this project, copy the env.example file to a file named .env, and then edit it to fill in the details. Enter your Snowtrace API key, and the private key of the account which will send the deployment transaction. With a valid .env file in place, first deploy your contract:

```shell
hardhat run --network fuji scripts/deploy.ts
```

Then, copy the deployment address and paste it in to replace `DEPLOYED_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` and `CONSTRUCTOR_ARGUMENTS` if needed in this command:

```shell
npx hardhat verify --network fuji DEPLOYED_CONTRACT_ADDRESS CONSTRUCTOR_ARGUMENTS
```

## Documentation

There is a documentation under the Avalanche's official documentation repository:
